            Gymnasium</a> in Ballerup, where I am from. My main interests are IT, skiing and computer games. I love
            learning new things, and I'm very interested in learning to code and write software, which is why I
            chose to
            study IT.</p>

        <ul class="intro">
            <li>I've worked as a ski-instructor for a year in both Spain and Switzerland, where I've learned to teach
                and
                lead a larger group of people. I also took with me the responsibility and focus of having a bunch of
                kids in
                my care.
            </li>
            <li>This I also learned at my second job, a temp at a kindergarten, where I learned to navigate a more
                regular
                workplace and environment. These jobs have been important lessons for me, and have helped me grow and find my purpose.
            </li>
            <li>I am from Denmark, and I'm half danish half hungarian. Because I have family all over the world, I've traveled a lot, and I love traveling to new places and meeting new people. When I'm traveling I tend to like hiking trips and ski trips the most. National parks and good ski resorts are my go to, but I also enjoy exploring the backcountry and unmarked trails. When skiing I mostly enjoy off-piste skiing, and when hiking I like to see beautiful places and climb mountains. When it comes to video games, I tend to like single player and exploratory games, but I also play multiplayer games like World of Warcraft and first-person shooters. My favourite game is Outer Wilds.</li>
